# PinoyQuest

It is a retro-style 2D RPG adventure inspired by the classic Pokémon: MyBoy but with a proudly Filipino heart. Set in a pixelated version of a vibrant Filipino town, players take on the role of a young hero on a quest to restore peace after mischievous spirits disrupt the harmony of traditional Filipino childhood games.
